                    <p class="sectiontext">The Australian Asbestos Stories website has been created by a team of media researchers at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia to give you easy access to information on asbestos-related diseases, health information for work and home, and to tell the history of asbestos in Australia and abroad. The project aims to develop an online resource everything Asbestos; its historical legacy, current impacts on Australian society and the ways in which we can all help to minimise its harmful effects on our health and wellbeing.</p>

                    <p class="sectiontext">Many of the stories relate to shared experiences in minesites and workplaces. Many deal with the trauma resulting from direct experience with illnesses – the deadly legacy of asbestos. The important thing is that these are personal stories and we thank all the contributors for sharing them with us.</p>
